# Web-Scraping-in-Python
This is a mini project where Web Scraping is used for extracting the name of countries from particular web page.
Web page used:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_area

BeautifulSoup is the python package which i have used for parsing the web page. I have used Requests module of python to send 
the request to web page.
